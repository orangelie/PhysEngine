## Features  
  
**The engine is a renderer for driving the game physics engine simulator.**  
It's based on DirectX12 single-threaded.  
The engine was built simply for simulation.  
However, this renderer will support **PBR**(physically based rendering) to show high-quality rendering results.  
  
Previously, the logic of physical engine development was referred to **[Game Physics Engine Development]** and made to check the results on a better quality level.  
  
Objects can be generated in a component design.  
It is designed to be relatively easy to customize for each object.
